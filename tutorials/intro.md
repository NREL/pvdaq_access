# Welcome to the PVDAQ Training

Here is a collection of Jupyter Journals ready to run in your browser 
through Google Collab and expore the capabilities of PVDAQ, RdTools, and PVAnalytics.

Clicking on the rocket-icon on the top allows you to launch the journals on 
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for interactive mode.
As per the instructions on each journal, you should uncomment the first line 
that reads `pip install ...`  to install the environment if you follow this mode.

You can also clone the repository and run them locally, following the 
instructions on the [PVDAQ Access Github page](https://github.com/NREL/pvdaq_access)
